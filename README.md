Hi, I'm Aapo and this is my place for personal programming projects.
Some of my favourite things in programming are premature optimization and figuring out the most obscure interfaces of a python library.

Topics I've dabbled on that can be found here:
- Machine learning, specifically model free RL
- GPU accelerated computing (JAX, graphics shaders)
- Data-analysis in experimental physics
